StarLover is a HTML5/Javascript game made in 24h for the first [R2DWild](https://portfolio-r2dwild.netlify.app/) Hackathon.

The theme of the Hackathon was "Star Love" and the only instruction was to make a call to a [Star Wars API](https://miadil.github.io/starwars-api/).

It was our first game using Javascript canvas. It was a lot of fun to make and we learnt a lot.
